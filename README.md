# AWS Lambda + Serverless = Awesome
In under 10 minutes, you will have a production and staging server running on AWS Lambda using a Serverless framework for NodeJs Lambda function. The Serverless framework helps you get up and running in production in no time. (or easier if you already have the AWS CLI installed!). This AWS Lambda article shows you how powerful functions as a service are and how easy it is to get up and running with them. Before we start our tutorial I would like to recap probably you already know or don't have any background about AWS Lambda and Serverless Framework, below briefly about them;
Serverless Framework — develop, deploy, troubleshoot and secure your serverless applications with radically less overhead and cost by using the Serverless Framework. The Serverless Framework consists of an open-source CLI and a hosted dashboard. Together, they provide you with full serverless application lifecycle management.
AWS Lambda —It let you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service — all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
